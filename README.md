# **Machine Learning Algorithms**

## What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on using data and algorithms to imitate the way a human learns, gradually increasing the accuracy in the process. Machine Learning Algorithms use historical data to learn patterns and predict the results for new output values. It is similar to how we predict the upcoming number in a sequence or solve puzzles. Machine Learning is used for various purposes such as facial recognition, spam dete detection, stock market prediction, recommendation systems etc.
